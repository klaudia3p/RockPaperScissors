# RockPaperScissors

This very simple game was my practise if/else/else in C#(Console app .NET Framework)
The idea of this game is to enter rock, paper or scissors and see if you win with automatically generated moves.


									Starting of the game:

It's very simple code, but maybe someone will find it useful 
Have fun :)
